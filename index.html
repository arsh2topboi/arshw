            <p>My favorite hobby is video games. It is fun and I get to play with my friends even if they are far away. My favorite games are Minecraft and Free Fire. Minecraft is a fantasy game.In order to finish the game you have to go to a world called "The End". Free fire is a survival game where you are with 50 players and you have to be the last man standing. I love playing videogames and i play it often. But I manage my time and balance studying, playing outside and gaming. Video games also help me connect to different people and eventually, make friends with them.
